"""Rule for `bash-rules.py`: deny a `git commit` that runs after another command in the same Bash call.

A command before the commit is usually a check, and chaining it to the commit lets the shell judge the check by an exit status that can lie: in `pytest | tail && git commit`, `&&` reads the exit status of `tail`, so failing tests still commit.
Run in separate calls, Codex reads the check's output before deciding to commit.
Commands after the commit (`git commit -m x && git log -1`) cannot change whether it happens, so they are left alone.
