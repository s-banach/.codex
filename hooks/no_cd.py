"""Rule for `bash-rules.py`: deny `cd`, `pushd`, and `popd`.

The hook input's `cwd` is the session directory, and the hook input omits a command's `workdir`, so after a `cd`, or with `workdir` set, `no_python_outside_venv.py` looks for the project's `.venv` in the wrong directory.
A `cd` does not carry over to the next command either: Codex starts every command in the session directory, or in the `workdir` the command sets.
A command that names its directories, with absolute paths or a program's directory flag, does the same thing whatever directory it starts in.
