"""PreToolUse hook for Bash: deny a bare `python` when the project has a virtualenv.

Reads the hook input JSON on stdin and writes a PreToolUse decision on stdout.
A bare `python` or `python3` runs whichever interpreter PATH resolves first, so
in a project holding a `.venv` it usually runs the system interpreter: imports
resolve to a different set of packages than the project installed, and the run
produces wrong results with no error.
An interpreter named by path (`.venv/bin/python`) and a `uv run` prefix are left
alone; both say which environment they run in.
